      Full-Stack IoT software engineer. My passion is engineering distributed
      back-end services for the modern world. I've worked with bare-metal
      micro-controllers using low-level comm protocols. Resource constrained
      embedded linux computers running optimized webservers and RPC interfaces.
      And expansive distributed micro-services in the cloud. My portfolio
      includes a full technology stack that ingests terabytes of data from IoT
      devices across the globe with live dashboards, data pipelines, business
      intelligence, and alerting tools.
